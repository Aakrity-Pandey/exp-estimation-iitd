      "answers": {
        "a": "A range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.",

        "a": "A confidence interval is a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.",

        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The margin of error is not the range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.",

      "question": "What is the sample size needed to decrease the width of a confidence interval?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increase the sample size.",
        "b": "Decrease the sample size."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Increasing the sample size leads to a decrease in the width of the confidence interval, resulting in a more precise estimation.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Decreasing the sample size would generally result in a wider confidence interval and less precise estimation."
